# Comparing Interpreter's execution time

## In this repository, I will be comparing รง's performance against other interpreted languages like Python, Java, JavaScript Node, Bash and Ruby.

### I will be creating two algorithms in each language:

The first algorithm just puts all numbers in an array in ascending order.

And the second one will calculate the mode between the numbers in the array.

### Then I will compare the execution time between the programming languages, executing each algorithm in each language three times and getting an average between the values to make a graph.

NB: Some programming languages here, such as Java and JS are not exactly Interpreted, being instead JIT (Just in Time) Compiled, which means they interpret the biggest part of the code, but some tasks that are more performance demanding like loops are directly transpiled into machine code.

It is important to remember that all of those tests have been carried out in the same Acer Aspire A315-41 laptop with Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS.
